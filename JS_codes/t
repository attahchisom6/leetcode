Consider a bug at the foot of a cylinder of height h and raduis r. Unable to climb out the cylinder vertically, decided to clim out by moving eith a vertical angle  theta to the circlular bottom at constant speeed. if it eventually  made it out.

1. start by drawing a pictorial representation of the problem
2. what is the name of the curve traced out by the bug b?
3. Using any coordinate system euitable to this situation, derive the equation of the curve, each logic towards ur solution should be represented pictorially
