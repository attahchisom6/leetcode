I am buildinng an Authentication service for a microservice, the achitecture is as follows
API GATEWAY
1. a request is sent from the frontend by a user.
2. the request passes throgh the api gateway where the follows action happens
    a. the user is checked in thhe database to determine its role
    b. if the role is neither admin nor a registered user, his role is determined as quest
    c. if he is an admin, a reduection to the admin page, if a registered user, we directly
       access the cache service for his informaion to determine wha he loves browsing,
       however if he is a guest, he can access certain routes, if he wants to perform actions
       he is not authorized to, he is aked to register b4 proceeding, if he agress the id directed
       to thr Authentication service.

AUTHENTICATION SERVICE
    a. Handle user login or registration depending on if he is regidtered or not
    b. once a user is regidtered, a session id and a session token rotation are created
    Sessionta Management
        i. session_id: A unique identifier for a user session, used to associate requests with the same session.

        session_token: A cryptographic token used for authentication and authorization. It should contain information like user ID, expiration time, and possibly roles or permissions.

        session  token rotation: Periodically refreshing session tokens enhances security by minimizing the window of opportunity for attackers. When a session token is rotated, the old token should be invalidated to prevent unaut
